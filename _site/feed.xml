The very mention of AI seems to bring out visceral amounts of seething within some people, which to me is something that makes very little sense.</p>

<p>From what I’ve heard, the reasons for their hatred boils down to the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>AI steals from artists</li>
  <li>AI will replace creative jobs</li>
  <li>AI will help in corporate exploitation</li>
</ul>

<p>I see the first criticism perhaps the most frequently. Any story narrator on the internet who might use AI pictures, for example, is often bombarded by people in the comments attacking their use of AI. Do you remember when Instagram had a trend of turning your picture into a Ghibli-style picture through AI a few months ago? At some point, my feed became more full of criticisms of this trend than it ever was of the original trend. The main criticism of this trend was that this was disrespectful to the original author, Hayao Miyazaki. I ask, how so? People should not have a monopoly on a style of making things. James Bonsack was the first man to automate the building of cigarettes; does that mean he was disrespecting his predecessors who made them by hand? I could list countless examples, as plenty of things which were handmade in the past are now automated. AI does not “steal” art any more than individuals steal art by being inspired from other individuals and drawing similar to their artstyles.</p>

<p>The second criticism, the idea that AI will replace creative jobs goes hand in hand with the first. I would actually say that this is not necessarily <em>wrong</em>, so much as it has the wrong idea of what jobs actually are. Jobs are not just random tasks people get paid for; they exist because people want or need the service they provide. The demand for a job exists only as long as the value of the work it does exists. If AI can make a job irrelevant, I would question just how much value that job had in the first place. If the public no longer needs a service, there is very little reason to actively slow progress to “save” jobs. Not to mention, many of these same people espouse that AI generated art feels soulless. If the “soulfulness” of an artwork matters so much to the public, I would think the introduction of AI would not affect demand so much, as it allegedly cannot provide the public with the soulful artworks they desire.</p>

<p>The third criticism states that AI will allow tech companies to profit off of unpaid labor and data while harming the workers who would have served these roles. This idea, once again, I feel as though comes more from visceral emotions than any lines of reasoning. It is anger towards tech giants that fuels this criticism, an anger which can be valid in many cases, but not so much in this case. Once again, if one’s job can be so easily replaced with AI, I reckon their job never had much societal value to begin with.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, most of the outrage against AI is not about ethics or fairness: it is about discomfort, envy, and a refusal to accept that the world moves on. AI does not steal art any more than cameras stole portraits, and it doesn’t “destroy” jobs any more than the printing press destroyed handwritten books. People screaming about corporate exploitation are really just projecting their anger at tech giants onto a tool that could make life easier. Hating AI doesn’t make it immoral; it just makes you predictable, reactive, and thoroughly behind the curve.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="technology" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[While Artificial Intelligence in my opinion is an unimaginably beneficial addition to human society, there is a large chunk of the population vehemently against anything made through the help of AI.

To procrastinate on actually writing something on my site that I made specifically to write in, I atttempted to create a better comment section, since the current one uses Utterances and needs one to log into GitHub; I tried to make an anonymous comment section kind of like 4chan and failed spectacularly and gave up halfway through.</p>

<p>At any rate, I imagine there is no better way to write a piece than to dig up some old discourse and elaborate on why I hold the opinions I expressed back then. I suppose there is no more fitting way in which to start than with the grounding for most of our worldviews: morality. Most of what I will say has already been covered by smarter people several times over, but this is a personal attempt to articulate it in my own way. Full disclosure, I use ChatGPT a lot to elaborate on my thoughts, and I am too lazy to rewrite whatever it says. Much of this is my ideas put together by AI.</p>

<p>To begin with, we must first clarify what morality is. At its bare bones, morality is one’s sense of right and wrong. It is the basis of almost every social order in human civilization, as well as the seed of almost every opinion an individual holds. If someone thinks abortion is murder, or that there ought to be more social justice for those deemed underprivileged, or that certain governments should never cross certain lines no matter the consequences, all of it traces back to that individual’s sense of right and wrong. Strip away that sense, and it becomes nearly pointless to hold views that don’t directly benefit oneself.</p>

<p>And yet, for something so essential, morality has no actual basis in reality when approached from a secular perspective. Two people of similar upbringing can hold radically different ideas about right and wrong, and neither is more correct. Much of moral debate presumes we all already share some axioms (for example, that murder is wrong), but even those axioms are groundless. In fact, they frequently collapse the moment they become inconvenient. When a controversial political commentator is shot, many cheer and go out of their way to justify it. The supposedly universal axiom evaporates when the target belongs to the out-group. What is taken as “universal” is, in practice, always conditional. History is a record of this selectivity: murder, rape, exploitation, oppression, all permitted or even celebrated when done to the other. Morality, despite its grand claims, has never been applied universally.</p>

<p>Some people argue that morality is subjective, yet still institutionally useful. I see little difference between saying morality is subjective and saying morality does not exist. Anyone can think anything, but thought without grounding carries no value. Music taste, for example, is subjective, but music still exists and one can still analyze and decipher music; morality has no such material existence. Morality is mere preference. No valid moral take exists at all, since all takes are equally baseless.</p>

<p>But even if morality is ungrounded, the question remains: why does it feel so inescapably binding? The answer is twofold: evolution and culture. Evolution endowed us with moral instincts because they served survival. Fairness within an in-group fosters trust, reduces conflict, and allows cooperation. To treat others decently is, in many cases, simply a strategy to secure reciprocal treatment. Culture then amplifies these instincts and molds them. What we call “cultural morality” in itself grows out of two forces: self-interest and collective pressure. The rules we adopt are the codification of our fears and dislikes. We forbid others from doing to us what we would not want done ourselves. And at the same time, what the majority finds repulsive or intolerable eventually crystallizes into law. The result is not an objective code of right and wrong, but a local consensus shaped by disgust and expedience.</p>

<p>The force of morality is its biological compulsion. Our biology influences us more than we realize. People will reproduce rather than adopt, even though adoption is probably more moral, because the biological drive to reproduce overwhelms moral reasoning. The drive creates the illusion of universality. People are emotional creatures; most act on instinct, not thought.</p>

<p>Attempts to “ground” morality in reason or duty are, in my view, attempts to disguise this emptiness. But you cannot ground what has no grounding. You may want to, and we as humans that rely on the existence of that grounding have every incentive to, but that does not change the reality. If you see an apple, it is an apple. You can write libraries convincing yourself otherwise, but the apple remains. Morality is the same: a brute fact of human instinct, not a truth about the world.</p>

<p>In a lot of ways, I believe religion partly acts as an attempt to ground morality. If it was not created to do that, it has at least evolved to do just that; theists very frequently use religion to ground their morality. But in my opinion, adding a deity into the mix doesn’t ground morality so much as it adds another layer of questioning to it. In most religions, God himself provides no basis for morality, other than that he commands it. But why should we follow a command just because it is a command, and what makes God’s sense of morality so much superior to ours? Divine commands, in my opinion, cannot provide a true foundation for morality, only the illusion of one. God’s commands are only authoritative if one accepts them, and accepting them requires prior moral agreement. One cannot find a true foundation without finding an actual <em>reason</em>, but unfortunately, a reason beyond basic biology does not exist.</p>

<p>In conclusion, morality is ungrounded. It is a product of evolution, culture, and human emotion, and while it may be useful, it does not reflect any objective reality. All moral systems, whether secular or religious, are ultimately attempts to give structure to something that has no inherent structure. Morality is therefore a human invention, not a universal truth.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="philosophy" /><category term="religion" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[As usual, I couldn’t really figure out what to write on the site upon making it.

<p>I’ve often been suggested to write a journal, but I fail to keep at it consistently because there is absolutely no point, in my opinion, of writing your happenings down in a blank page of paper for no reason. I figure with my thoughts being out there online (even if no one reads it), it will help in finding the motivation to actually write down my thoughts.</p>

<p>Major props to my best friend, greatest enemy, personal therapist, girlfriend and personal doormat ChatGPT for helping me with this site.
