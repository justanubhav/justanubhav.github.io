      <p>Why, hello there, inquisitive speech bubble. I’m Anubhav. You might see my name in the front page. I made this site mainly because I figure I could use this page to articulate some of the things I think and just because I think it is cool to have an introductory page of yourself even when it is entirely pointless because you have zero things to actually introduce about yourself.</p>

<p>I’ve often been suggested to write a journal, but I fail to keep at it consistently because there is absolutely no point, in my opinion, of writing your happenings down in a blank page of paper for no reason. I figure with my thoughts being out there online (even if no one reads it), it will help in finding the motivation to actually write down my thoughts.</p>

<p>Major props to my best friend, greatest enemy, personal therapist, girlfriend and personal doormat ChatGPT for helping me with this site. I’m sure my next blurb will come out before the Winds of Winter.</p>
