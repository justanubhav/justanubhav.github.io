          <p class="post-excerpt">I don‚Äôt know how unique I am for this, but one of my favorite activities to do is worldbuilding for no good reason. I never intend to write stories with it (I am, in fact, fascinatingly bad at writing stories, and writing in general, as one can observe from reading my ‚Äúblurbs‚Äù), but I love to spend hours building maps with complex geopolitics and cultures.

          <p class="post-excerpt">Why, hello there, inquisitive speech bubble. I‚Äôm Anubhav. You might see my name in the front page. I made this site mainly because I figure I could use this page to articulate some of the things I think and just because I think it is cool to have an introductory page of yourself even when it is entirely pointless because you have zero things to actually introduce about yourself.
