          <p class="post-excerpt">I don‚Äôt know how unique I am for this, but one of my favorite activities to do is worldbuilding for no good reason. I never intend to write stories with it (I am, in fact, fascinatingly bad at writing stories, and writing in general, as one can observe from reading my ‚Äúblurbs‚Äù), but I love to spend hours building maps with complex geopolitics and cultures.

          <p class="post-date">September 23, 2025</p>
          <p class="post-excerpt">While Artificial Intelligence in my opinion is an unimaginably beneficial addition to human society, there is a large chunk of the population vehemently against anything made through the help of AI. The very mention of AI seems to bring out visceral amounts of seething within some people, which to me is something that makes very little sense.
