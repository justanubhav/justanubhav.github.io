I don't know how unique I am for this, but one of my favorite activities to do is worldbuilding for no good reason. I never intend to write stories with it (I am, in fact, fascinatingly bad at writing stories, and writing in general, as one can observe from reading my "blurbs"), but I love to spend hours building maps with complex geopolitics and cultures.

My favorite tool for this is called Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator. The name is self-explanatory: It generates a continental (sometimes mult-continental) map for you with randomized nation-states and empires. It is *extremely* detailed, from detailing generated randomly provinces, biomes, heightmaps, temperatures, routes, cultures, burgs, diplomatic relations, military prowess, all the way down to things I've not even touched yet. It works perfectly for what I want to do, and is an extremely addictive tool for me that I can spend hours upon hours in.

I decided one day that a use for the worlds I build would be to play Dungeons & Dragons with it. My first try was with ChatGPT, but ChatGPT when it comes to narratives is honestly kind of... weak. It's very clich√©, not very narratively consistent, and hallucinates a lot. I decided to give DeepSeek a try therefore, and I had heretofore not really used DeepSeek before. I found out it was surprisingly excellent. I found that DeepSeek actually has *surprising* narrative consistency, and seems to recall details I told to it several hours into the campaign. Its only problem seems to be that it needs to be constantly reminded that the world is harsh and that consequences for a lesser roll are real. Otherwise, it simply makes the journey too safe for you. It is also kind of bad at grounding stories, and oftentimes, most campaigns will focus on something of very high scale and stakes if not told explicitly not to (something that threatens the world), whereas I prefer grounded and small stories.

In any case, it has been my favorite activity ever since I started not very long ago. Every DnD campaign I finish, I add it to my world's history in Azgaar. It makes for an even more rich and complex world.
