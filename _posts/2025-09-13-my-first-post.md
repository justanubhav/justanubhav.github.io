Why, hello there, inquisitive speech bubble. I'm Anubhav. You might see my name in the front page. I made this site mainly because I figure I could use this page to articulate some of the things I think and just because I think it is cool to have an introduction page of yourself even if it is entirely pointless because you have zero things to actually introduce about yourself.

Stay tuned for the biyearly update. I'm sure the next blog post will come out before Winds of Winter.
