As usual, I couldn't really figure out what to write on the site upon making it. To procrastinate on actually writing something on my site that I made specifically to write in, I atttempted to create a better comment section, since the current one uses Utterances and needs one to log into GitHub; I tried to make an anonymous comment section kind of like 4chan and failed spectacularly and gave up halfway through.

At any rate, I imagine there is no better way to write a piece than to dig up some old discourse and elaborate on why I hold the opinions I expressed back then. I suppose there is no more fitting way in which to start than the grounding for most of our worldviews: Morality. Most of what I will say has already been covered by smarter people several times, but this is more of a personal attempt to articulate them in my own way.

To begin with, we must first clarify what morality is. Morality, at the bare bones, is one's innate sense of right and wrong. It is the origin of almost every social order of human civilization, as well as almost every opinion any individual holds. If someone thinks abortion is murder, or that there ought to be higher social justice for people they deem underprivileged, or that there ought not to be certain actions taken by certain governments at any cost, all of that stems from that person's innate sense of right and wrong. Without that sense of right and wrong, it is nearly pointless to hold views that don't directly benefit oneself.

And yet, for something so essential that nearly every social institution is grounded upon it, morality, from a secular perspective, has no actual basis in reality. Two people of similar origin can hold vastly different opinions on what constitutes right or wrong and neither of them would be more correct in their opinions. Much of the debate in morality presumes an existing set of moral axioms to already be present in everyone (for example, that murder is wrong), but the concept of using those axioms themselves is faulty, because those axioms themselves have no grounding in reality. In fact, very often, people make major exceptions to those axioms when holding true to them would inconvenience or disadvantage them. If a controversial political commentator were to be shot in public, for example, a lot of people would cheer for it and go out of their way to justify it, despite the commonly accepted axiomatic belief that murder is wrong. All of this to say: Even what people commonly consider axiomatic beliefs oftentimes tend to be beliefs they only ever apply to their own in-group, whatever that may be. Outside that in-group, we have thousands of years of humankind's wrongdoings to prove that moral axioms are never universal.

Throughout history, what we call morality is something we have only ever applied to our own in-group. We hate murder, but we cheer for it when it happens to our enemies. Rape has always been seen as a horrific crime, but war rape has always been extremely common, and perhaps seen by the invading soldiers as deserved. There are many examples of this I could provide, but humans are very selective when it comes to applying their "universal" morality.

Some people would argue that morality is subjective and still has institutional value as a subjective concept. I would posit that arguing that morality is subjective is still mostly equivalent to arguing that morality does not exist. Anyone can think anything, but what gives their thinking value is some grounding in the real world. As morality has none, it makes no one's take more valuable than another's, even if it may seem so on the surface. The problem of moral relativism, then, becomes that all moral takes are equally valid, or more precisely, that no valid moral take exists at all, since anyone is free to think anything they want.

Even if morality lacks any objective grounding, the question remains: why does it feel so inescapably binding to us? I would argue that this sense of compulsion arises from two intertwined sources: evolution and culture. From an evolutionary standpoint, moral instincts function as survival heuristics. A sense of fairness or justice within one’s in-group promotes trust, reduces internal conflict, and ensures cooperation in environments where solitary survival would be nearly impossible. To treat others decently is, in many cases, simply a strategy for ensuring reciprocal treatment.

Culture then amplifies and shapes these instincts. What we call “cultural morality” often grows out of two forces: self-interest and collective pressure. The rules we agree upon are frequently just the codification of the things we personally fear or dislike. The things we would not want done to us, we prohibit doing to others, not because they are objectively wrong, but because enforcing that prohibition benefits us collectively. At the same time, cultural morality is influenced by what the majority finds offensive or intolerable. Practices considered normal in one society may be outlawed in another, not due to some deeper truth, but because shared disgust or outrage crystallizes into law.

Social order, in my opinion, ought to stem mostly from *pragmatism*. The purpose of morality itself is pragmatic: it comes out of mutual benefit. The way in which our moral forces have always acted have been of the visceral variety: guilt, disgust, shame, outrage. That is the basis of social order to this day.
